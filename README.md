Hello Friends, and Mentors,

I, Dave has finally decided to join github and get cracking on learning about the bountiful and resourceful world of programming, I intend to learn everything I can absorb and to become a better progammer as a result of learning new things. I am currently somewhat beginner but I believe with your help I can become much better. I do appreciate any support and guidance on becoming a better and more skillful developer as time goes on.
